🧠 Project Overview

This is a betting web application that allows users to view upcoming matches and manage user accounts through authentication features such as login and registration. The project focuses on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and backend development using C#.

🧱 Architecture

The application follows a Three-Tier Architecture, ensuring a clear separation of responsibilities:

Presentation Layer

User Interface (Web pages)

Handles user interaction and displays data

Business Logic Layer
